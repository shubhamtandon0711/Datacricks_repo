# 📊 New Supplier Data Analysis - WI Project

Welcome to the official repository for the **New Supplier Data Analysis** project, developed as part of a quality improvement initiative in supplier management and process monitoring! 🚀

---

## 🧠 Project Objective

To **analyze new supplier data** efficiently and automate the extraction of quality metrics, failure rates, and performance insights using Python & Pandas. The goal is to **visualize trends**, **highlight root causes**, and provide **actionable insights** that help improve supplier reliability and ensure data-driven decision-making. 📈

## 🔍 What This Project Does

- ✅ Reads and cleans supplier data
- 📊 Performs Pareto analysis of supplier issues
- 📌 Identifies recurring defects (Root Cause Analysis)
- 🎯 Detects suppliers with high rejection or failure rates
- 📍 Highlights process and delivery-related issues
- 🧩 Supports APQP (Advanced Product Quality Planning) tasks

---

## 💡 Use Case Examples

- 🔎 **Supplier A** has 12 NCRs (Non-Conformance Reports); 9 due to "Blow holes" – possibly a **casting process issue**.
- 🚨 **Supplier B** shows repeated NCRs for "Deep scratches" and "Peeling" – indicating **poor surface treatment** or handling.
- 🔧 **Machining defects**, **material mixing**, or **measurement deviations** are flagged with trends and dates.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- 🐍 Python 3
- 📚 Pandas, NumPy
- 📉 Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)
- 🗃️ Excel (as input/output format)
- 💼 Real-world industrial supplier data
